# Register-go
Register a service on a Eureka server and gets other apps endpoints from Eureka.


### To build this service

#### Dependencies
```
go get -u github.com/FiloSottile/gvt
gvt restore
```

#### Go tools
In order to build the project locally you need to make sure that the repository directory is located in the correct
$GOPATH directory: $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/cloudedgemicroserviceteam/register/. Once that is in place you can build by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.org/cloudedgemicroserviceteam/register/cmd/register-go/
go build -o register
```

The result is a binary named `register-go`, in the current directory.

### API Endpoints

All URIs are relative to *http://localhost:1906/api*

Class | Method | HTTP request | Description

*AppsApi* | **GetAllAppsByName** | **Get** /apps/{appName}/all | Get all apps endpoints by app name
*AppsApi* | **GetAppsByName** | **Get** /apps/{appName} | Get an app endpoint by app name
